        <p>This was the first dynamic website made by Brandon Rehayem.
           It was built with a humble flask architecture and was truly a labor of love.
           Though I now have experience with using more complex technologies,
            this site holds a special place for me as a critical benchmark in my understanding of web development.
         </p>
         <p class="center">As R. Lee Ermey put it: "There are many like it, but this one is mine."</p>
        <p>You can navigate the website by clicking the items listed at the top. If you're up to it, why not leave a short poem or try to get a highscore in asteroids?
        My portfolio is also available. Enjoy your time here.</p>
