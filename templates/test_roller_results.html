  <b>Test Results</b>
  <p>Each bracket represents a takedown of the target by the selected weapon</p>
  <p>The numbers in the brackets each represent damage done to the target each turn.</p>
  <br>
  <p>The number of numbers in each bracket represent the total number of turns that had to be resolved to bring the target down.</p>
  <p>For example, [4,5,6] means that the weapon required 3 turns to bring its target down as there are 3 numbers in the brackets.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Note: some weapons attack multiple times each turn such as the Heavy Bolter. The total damage done in a single turn is added together.</p>
  <p>Hit, wound, and save rolls are calculated based on pseudorandom numbers each time a calculation is made</p>
